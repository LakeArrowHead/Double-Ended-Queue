# Double-Ended-Queue
my code for CS61B project Data Structures

In this project, I built implementations of a “Double Ended Queue” using both lists and arrays in a package that other classes can use. 
The project is roughly split into two halves: the data structure portion and the application portion.

In the data structure part of the project, I created two Java files: LinkedListDeque.java and ArrayDeque.java.
In the application part of this project, I use my package to ultimately implement a sound synthesizer capable of playing music from Guitar Hero.
